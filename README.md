# Official Implementation for MICCAI 2026 Submission

This repository contains the official code and dataset metadata to support the findings presented in our MICCAI 2026 submission.

## 📊 Dataset Preview & Anonymization
To adhere to the **double-blind review process** and ensure patient privacy, the dataset provided here is a blinded preview version:

* **CSV Metadata:** Approximately 80% of labels and clinical parameters have been randomly masked.
* **Image Data:** Retinal fundus images have been downsampled to **32x32 pixels**. These serve as structural placeholders to verify the code's functionality without compromising data integrity or anonymity.
* **Full Release:** Upon completion of the peer-review process, the high-resolution dataset and complete metadata will be made publicly available.
